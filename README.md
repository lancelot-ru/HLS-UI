# HLS-UI

A little utility that displays information about HLS streams. An HLS stream may consist of several videos of different resolutions and bitrates, as well as different audio streams of different bitrates.

Supports only the so-called VOD (Video on Demand) mode, when all stream segments are already on the server.
